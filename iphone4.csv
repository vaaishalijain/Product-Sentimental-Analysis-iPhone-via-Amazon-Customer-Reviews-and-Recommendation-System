The home button does not work. After the phone is on for a long amount of time, the screen turns yellow.The worst part about it is, I have always bragged on Amazon's Customer Service. They've always done me right. This time, they did not. They basically told me to take it to an Apple Store. I paid $250 for this phone. I paid $250, for a working, functional phone, that was almost ""Like New"". Amazon has lost a lot of credibility among the online community, with lackluster service and promotions. They've definitely lost another customer with me. All I want is the phone replaced with a working phone, that my girlfriend can use. Is that too much to ask? A simple replacement?To anyone reading this, if you are looking to buy a phone, do not do it from these people. Save your money, and just buy it off Craigslist. I would love for somebody from Amazon to contact me and make good on this deal. I have always respected and bragged about this company.

Phone manufacturers and wireless companies ask a million questions to unlock phones. If you can avoid the hassle of unlocking phones, you should because it ain't fun.",,2,2

After I went to the AT& T store got its SIM card and was already to go, I found out that the home button only works occasionally. It is unfortunate for such a high priced item.

Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - AT&T,Apple,208.79,3,"I was excited to have gotten this phone in spring of 2013. I upgraded from an iPhone 3GS (yes I know I am behind on the times here). The phone carried so much memory and data that I was able to keep up with the new data downloads or whatever you call it. I never once had to erase or delete my apps and camera roll (as what I had to to do with my iPhone 3GS).Let's fast forward...I only used the phone for 11 months. Just right after I upgraded it to the new iOS (Spring 2014), my iPhone 4 acted up badly!! I couldn't get out of an app for how many times I hit the ""home"" button. It drove me crazy. And I couldn't even get into my call screen without having to hit home so many more times. I hated my phone because of the iOS that was downloaded at the time.I parted ways with my iphone4 (it was a sad moment) and left AT&T to be with Verizon.Verizon embraced me and got me the iPhone 5s. Yes it was a huge leap from the early iphone 4 to now an IPhone 5s (yea I felt like I was ballin' like a rockstar....until iphone 6 came out and then I ran out of memory on my 16gb iPhone 5s)....yea just because I left my iPhone 4 32gb for an IPhone 5s 16gb; I sure miss all those extra stored memory of my iphone4. It's not always greener on the other side. But damn that iOS upgrade that ruined my iPhone 4, otherwise me and the iPhone 4 would still be together no matter of upgraded phones I could've gotten. :(",,1,3

So I called Amazon and they refunded my money immediately and I reordered a new phone. I got the phone today and took it to the Apple store to make sure it was new but they told me that the serial number on this phone had been scratched and someone had been using it in the past.

Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - AT&T,Apple,208.79,1,"I purchased 2 Apple iPhone 4 phones from iDeal Expert last month: both looked brand new...but clearly, looks can be deceiving.From the start, one phone had a problem where the recipient heard a strong echo/distortion when speaking which interfered with the conversation. When I sent an email through Amazon clearly articulating the problem to the company, I received a brief response from their team: ""Have you tried calling the manufacture for an exchange?"".Considering my options, I decided to take my phone to an expert to see whether he could solve the problem. A couple of seconds after opening the case, he told me that the phone was not a new one, but refurbished. At a glance, he could see clear evidence of water damage, and it was missing all kinds of screws, fasteners..etc.I was horrified to learn this, and deeply troubled that iDeal Expert considers this acceptable practice - particularly given their supposed ""Complete Customer Satisfaction Guarantee: We stand behind the quality of our products with an iron-clad 100% guarantee. We are in the business of building long-term relationships with our customers, and we are confident that you will be satisfied with each and every purchase made from us. We offer an exclusive EZ NO-HASSLE RETURN POLICY. If for any reason you are not satisfied, simply send your product back to us for an immediate replacement or refund.""In my opinion, iDeal Expert has displayed a flagrant disregard of integrity and have manifest very poor business ethics and practice. I fail to see how such behaviour can lead to ""long-term relationships"", nor to fully-satisfied customers.If my experience is anything to go by, my strong recommendation to all potential purchasers is ""BUYERS BEWARE!"".UPDATE: shortly after my posting, I received an email from the iDeal Expert team as follows: ""This was bought in August, we are now in OCTOBER and cannot accept a return this is past 60 days and we will not accept a return."" I responded to correct their error - reminding them that I had in fact notified their team of the problem well within the time frame, and had even received their acknowledgement of that email.I remain deeply concerned that iDeal Xpert has not only sold defective goods, but then chose to use their 60-time period as an excuse for not dealing with the problem. I still fail to see how such poor business practices are deemed acceptable by the company.UPDATE #2: today, the screen of my iPhone 4 went blank...without any warning, nor any good reason. The phone is again back with my tech expert to try to resolve...",,9,9

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (Black) - AT&T,Apple,99.99,3,"I was excited to have gotten this phone in spring of 2013. I upgraded from an iPhone 3GS (yes I know I am behind on the times here). The phone carried so much memory and data that I was able to keep up with the new data downloads or whatever you call it. I never once had to erase or delete my apps and camera roll (as what I had to to do with my iPhone 3GS).Let's fast forward...I only used the phone for 11 months. Just right after I upgraded it to the new iOS (Spring 2014), my iPhone 4 acted up badly!! I couldn't get out of an app for how many times I hit the ""home"" button. It drove me crazy. And I couldn't even get into my call screen without having to hit home so many more times. I hated my phone because of the iOS that was downloaded at the time.I parted ways with my iphone4 (it was a sad moment) and left AT&T to be with Verizon.Verizon embraced me and got me the iPhone 5s. Yes it was a huge leap from the early iphone 4 to now an IPhone 5s (yea I felt like I was ballin' like a rockstar....until iphone 6 came out and then I ran out of memory on my 16gb iPhone 5s)....yea just because I left my iPhone 4 32gb for an IPhone 5s 16gb; I sure miss all those extra stored memory of my iphone4. It's not always greener on the other side. But damn that iOS upgrade that ruined my iPhone 4, otherwise me and the iPhone 4 would still be together no matter of upgraded phones I could've gotten. :(",,1,3

So I called Amazon and they refunded my money immediately and I reordered a new phone. I got the phone today and took it to the Apple store to make sure it was new but they told me that the serial number on this phone had been scratched and someone had been using it in the past.

I found this deal, and I was very excited to get it for her. I've had great experiences with the Amazon Warehouse, I've bought numerous games on here.Anyways, I went with my great experiences and bought the phone. I give the phone to her on Christmas Day. The home button does not work. After the phone is on for a long amount of time, the screen turns yellow.The worst part about it is, I have always bragged on Amazon's Customer Service. They've always done me right. This time, they did not. They basically told me to take it to an Apple Store. I paid $250 for this phone. I paid $250, for a working, functional phone, that was almost ""Like New"". Amazon has lost a lot of credibility among the online community, with lackluster service and promotions. They've definitely lost another customer with me. All I want is the phone replaced with a working phone, that my girlfriend can use. Is that too much to ask? A simple replacement?To anyone reading this, if you are looking to buy a phone, do not do it from these people. Save your money, and just buy it off Craigslist. I would love for somebody from Amazon to contact me and make good on this deal. I have always respected and bragged about this company.

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (Black) - AT&T,Apple,99.99,1,PRODUCT IS NOT NEW AS STATED. PRODUCT IS REFURBISHED. Don't buy this phone from planet mobile. Mine had all sorts of problems right off the bat but I just dealt with them until after a few months when it completely broke same as another reviewer said where it only stays on for a few minutes and then a yellow or red screen flashes and it restarts. It stays at 1%. They said I couldn't return it because it was past the 90 days but that the manufacture warranty would still be good since all iPhones have a 1 year warranty. Well I checked and it was expired and Apple said the phone was purchased in 2010. I bought it in 2014. That means it is REFURBISHED NOT NEW the description is a lie but Amazon said I wasnt covered by the A to Z coverage because I didn't let them know the product was not as described in the first FOURTEEN days. I had no way of knowing it was refurbished because by all intents and purposes it was a new phone but it lasted just long enough to seem fine until it was too late to return. And I had no idea it was refurbished until I schedule the manufacture warranty as was suggested. I have tried to make continuous claims and they always say they understand but I always get denied thanks to the 14 days period I needed to respond. CHECK YOUR SERIAL NUMBER upon receiving it to see if your warranty is expired. Then you'll know it refurbished. I wish someone had told me that before I wasted my money.,,1,1

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (Black) - AT&T,Apple,99.99,1,"I purchased 2 Apple iPhone 4 phones from iDeal Expert last month: both looked brand new...but clearly, looks can be deceiving.From the start, one phone had a problem where the recipient heard a strong echo/distortion when speaking which interfered with the conversation. When I sent an email through Amazon clearly articulating the problem to the company, I received a brief response from their team: ""Have you tried calling the manufacture for an exchange?"".Considering my options, I decided to take my phone to an expert to see whether he could solve the problem. A couple of seconds after opening the case, he told me that the phone was not a new one, but refurbished. At a glance, he could see clear evidence of water damage, and it was missing all kinds of screws, fasteners..etc.I was horrified to learn this, and deeply troubled that iDeal Expert considers this acceptable practice - particularly given their supposed ""Complete Customer Satisfaction Guarantee: We stand behind the quality of our products with an iron-clad 100% guarantee. We are in the business of building long-term relationships with our customers, and we are confident that you will be satisfied with each and every purchase made from us. We offer an exclusive EZ NO-HASSLE RETURN POLICY. If for any reason you are not satisfied, simply send your product back to us for an immediate replacement or refund.""In my opinion, iDeal Expert has displayed a flagrant disregard of integrity and have manifest very poor business ethics and practice. I fail to see how such behaviour can lead to ""long-term relationships"", nor to fully-satisfied customers.If my experience is anything to go by, my strong recommendation to all potential purchasers is ""BUYERS BEWARE!"".UPDATE: shortly after my posting, I received an email from the iDeal Expert team as follows: ""This was bought in August, we are now in OCTOBER and cannot accept a return this is past 60 days and we will not accept a return."" I responded to correct their error - reminding them that I had in fact notified their team of the problem well within the time frame, and had even received their acknowledgement of that email.I remain deeply concerned that iDeal Xpert has not only sold defective goods, but then chose to use their 60-time period as an excuse for not dealing with the problem. I still fail to see how such poor business practices are deemed acceptable by the company.UPDATE #2: today, the screen of my iPhone 4 went blank...without any warning, nor any good reason. The phone is again back with my tech expert to try to resolve...",,9,9

I've had great experiences with the Amazon Warehouse, I've bought numerous games on here.Anyways, I went with my great experiences and bought the phone. I give the phone to her on Christmas Day. The home button does not work. After the phone is on for a long amount of time, the screen turns yellow.The worst part about it is, I have always bragged on Amazon's Customer Service. They've always done me right. This time, they did not. They basically told me to take it to an Apple Store. I paid $250 for this phone. I paid $250, for a working, functional phone, that was almost ""Like New"". Amazon has lost a lot of credibility among the online community, with lackluster service and promotions. They've definitely lost another customer with me. All I want is the phone replaced with a working phone, that my girlfriend can use. Is that too much to ask? A simple replacement?To anyone reading this, if you are looking to buy a phone, do not do it from these people. Save your money, and just buy it off Craigslist. I would love for somebody from Amazon to contact me and make good on this deal. I have always respected and bragged about this company.

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (Black) - AT&T,Apple,99.99,3,"I was excited to have gotten this phone in spring of 2013. I upgraded from an iPhone 3GS (yes I know I am behind on the times here). The phone carried so much memory and data that I was able to keep up with the new data downloads or whatever you call it. I never once had to erase or delete my apps and camera roll (as what I had to to do with my iPhone 3GS).Let's fast forward...I only used the phone for 11 months. Just right after I upgraded it to the new iOS (Spring 2014), my iPhone 4 acted up badly!! I couldn't get out of an app for how many times I hit the ""home"" button. It drove me crazy. And I couldn't even get into my call screen without having to hit home so many more times. I hated my phone because of the iOS that was downloaded at the time.I parted ways with my iphone4 (it was a sad moment) and left AT&T to be with Verizon.Verizon embraced me and got me the iPhone 5s. Yes it was a huge leap from the early iphone 4 to now an IPhone 5s (yea I felt like I was ballin' like a rockstar....until iphone 6 came out and then I ran out of memory on my 16gb iPhone 5s)....yea just because I left my iPhone 4 32gb for an IPhone 5s 16gb; I sure miss all those extra stored memory of my iphone4. It's not always greener on the other side. But damn that iOS upgrade that ruined my iPhone 4, otherwise me and the iPhone 4 would still be together no matter of upgraded phones I could've gotten. :(",,1,3

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (Black) - Verizon,Apple,69.98,5,"After Verizon changed its upgrade cycle that coincided with both of my phone upgrades, I was left to either replace my son's non-functioning phone by purchasing an iPhone 5 for over $600, wait for next year to upgrade/replace or pay $200 to repair my son's originally free phone. I opted to check out what was being offered for last year's iPhone on Amazon and found a reasonably priced slightly used iPhone 4 with a great deal of memory. The device works as expected, no blemishes (at least none that I could find and I think there was mention of typical minor wear and tear - I saw none but I think that has to be put out there for used/refurb devices) and all cords, chargers were included in packaging. It was delivered early and my son is thoroughly pleased to go from a free Samsung smartphone to an iPhone 4 (granted he wanted the 5 but he's 15 - he'll live...besides he's happy to be at the same level his friends are at with their phones). I will be purchasing my phone this way and going outside of Verizon's market from now on. This seller is outstanding, the service and quality easily exceeds expectations.

My husband has had music coming out of the phone for no reason. He did not have any music on at the time. The cell phone freezing up and not responding to touch. The other one I bought for myself will not allow me to type Text messages with certain letters (like the T and g do not work). I cannot open the phone I have to swipe it many many times before it will open if at all. I'm so frustrated with this phone.",,1,1

Well that should have been my first red flag because the phone was only $25 (including a case, screen protector, and bluetooth). Out of frustration, I purchased the iPhone 4 in hopes that it would be a dramatic improvement compared to my Droid X2. I purchased it used, in very good condition. Aside from a minor scratch on the screen, the phone was in very good condition. The only problem I have is the home button. It either sticks, or it doesn't work immediately. But other than that, the phone itself is awesome and unless another Droid comes my way that can take the cake, I'm sticking to the iPhone.",,1,4

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (Black) - Verizon,Apple,69.98,5,"Phones... People have strong feelings about their cell phones it seems but when it comes down to usability, simplicity and just 'working' pretty much all of the time, still no one does it better than Apple and the iPhone.I know you can customize the Droids more here and there, I know there's no widgets, no this and no that. But there's also more security, more safety, more updates that roll out to everyone as soon as they're ready, more people using an iPhone 4 who still get to use pretty much the same features as the iPhone 5 because the software is available for both phones at the same time.The app selection is better, the best apps come out for iPhone first and the screen is great now that they've put the whole 'Retina Display' thing out there, the only real negative is the screen size, which in today's world, should really be bigger than 3.5"". Unless you have a very specific need for an Android, most users will find the iPhone just perfect for what they want to do.",,1,5

Well, that may have been true, the reality was that the WiFi worked horribly, and the primary button worked intermittently.

Now I have a new 6s iPhone ☺",,1,2

I tried initiating a return with Amazon which was rejected with a message stating I had to call customer service. How the heck am I suppose to call customer service if I don't have a phone?

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (White) - Verizon,Apple,115,2,"Eh.. it was an old phone. Probably the first one ever made. I'm not sure about that, but I had problems with the screen zooming on its own and then sticking there. This might happen while on a call (from which I couldn't hang up because the hangup button was way off screen) or it might happen while I'm browsing the internet. I had to restart the phone to get the screen back the right size. It was very frustrating and I deactived it to go to a different, less problematic phone. I would have liked to have known about the issues this phone had ahead of time. I will probably not buy from the company that sold this again for the reason mentioned above.",,1,2
Apple iPhone 4 32GB (White) - Verizon,Apple,115,4,"it's not the ""be all and end all"" device that Apple zealots would have you believe.This has been my first apple device, and it's certainly adequate. It's not bad, but it's not light-years ahead of other devices either.It's not without bugs or quirks. Most outstanding: it has problems with DHCP with my wifi-cable modem where I need to turn wifi on the phone off and then on again in order to get traffic flowing again. This need has revealed another quirk where, on occassion, Wifi will *not* turn off. Sometimes the slider (on-off switch) bounces back to the ""on"" position. Sometimes it looks like it turns off, but when I go back to the main settings screen and then return to the wifi settings screen, the wifi switch is back on again. In this situation, I go through a cycle of turning wifi off 3 - 8 times before it actually remains off.Text entry is simply uninspired. For all Apple's much bally-hewed design talents, they certainly didn't waste any cleverness surging beyond a basic keyboard. The phone's auto-complete feature is nice, but I had better auto-completion on a Palm V over 10 years ago. I pine for T9 to accelerate text entry.Built-in email is well integrated & supports multiple accounts. Build-in calendar is less versatile.Speaker phone is adequate, but I've had better from cheaper phones.Oh, and if you only want to use wifi-sourced data on your phone & avoid data plan fees, iPhones work perfectly fine without a data plan.At the risk of stating the obvious: if you don't have a data plan, you don't get google maps, email, etc. when you're out-of-range of a wifi network. For me, this is fine. The carriers categorize text messaging as non-data, so you can pay for that if you like.Sure, without data you take a hit on certain (& very few) phone features; the most significant & least obvious, I'd say, would be the log of outstanding voicemails the iPhone can show you.-- Without data, you just get an indicator that you have voicemail to be listened to.-- With data, you get an inventory of who left you voicemails at what times.***All*** iPhone apps have settings to enable/disable data transfer over the phone network. The phone also has a ""master"" setting for this, too.DO NOT let Verizon, Sprint, etc. tell you that a data plan is necessary to operate one of these on their networks. It's simply not so, and -- unless they've changed their tunes in the past 2 years -- they will not tell you this. Verizon & Sprint (and probably all other carriers) will make you get a data plan to have one of these on their network, and they won't tell you anything different. When I've asked them, they've been unequivocal on this requirement. Their justification for this is completely bogus; namely that smart phones need data to operate.I've learned, however, of 2 ways to get around this requirement.1 - get a pay-as-you-go account2 - piggy back your iPhone on an account with someone else's iPhone that has a data plan.(in my case, my wife's work pays for her phone & plan; I piggy-back on the account, but don't use data.",,2,8
Apple iPhone 4 32GB (White) - Verizon,Apple,115,1,"Phone wouldn't work 10 minutes after I got it. I've only had it for 5 hours. When I first turned it on, it took forever and I noticed these lines going across the screen. At first it would go black if I was on it for more than 30 seconds now the screen keeps fading black everytime I try to unlock it and will randomely shut off. Seems to me like water damage because this is what happened to my last iphone I got wet. So in that case this is a scam.",,2,2

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (White) - Verizon,Apple,115,4,"I had originally owned a Droid X2, and I got it off a Groupon. Well that should have been my first red flag because the phone was only $25 (including a case, screen protector, and bluetooth). Out of frustration, I purchased the iPhone 4 in hopes that it would be a dramatic improvement compared to my Droid X2. I purchased it used, in very good condition. Aside from a minor scratch on the screen, the phone was in very good condition. The only problem I have is the home button. It either sticks, or it doesn't work immediately. But other than that, the phone itself is awesome and unless another Droid comes my way that can take the cake, I'm sticking to the iPhone.",,1,4

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (White) - Verizon,Apple,115,5,"Phones... People have strong feelings about their cell phones it seems but when it comes down to usability, simplicity and just 'working' pretty much all of the time, still no one does it better than Apple and the iPhone.I know you can customize the Droids more here and there, I know there's no widgets, no this and no that. But there's also more security, more safety, more updates that roll out to everyone as soon as they're ready, more people using an iPhone 4 who still get to use pretty much the same features as the iPhone 5 because the software is available for both phones at the same time.The app selection is better, the best apps come out for iPhone first and the screen is great now that they've put the whole 'Retina Display' thing out there, the only real negative is the screen size, which in today's world, should really be bigger than 3.5"".

I am going to be using this phone for the next few months or until I find a reason to not like it anymore. Absolutely satisfied, and am convinced to get the iPhone 5 when I'm eligible!

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (White) - Verizon,Apple,115,4,"it's not the ""be all and end all"" device that Apple zealots would have you believe.This has been my first apple device, and it's certainly adequate. It's not bad, but it's not light-years ahead of other devices either.It's not without bugs or quirks. Most outstanding: it has problems with DHCP with my wifi-cable modem where I need to turn wifi on the phone off and then on again in order to get traffic flowing again. This need has revealed another quirk where, on occassion, Wifi will *not* turn off. Sometimes the slider (on-off switch) bounces back to the ""on"" position. Sometimes it looks like it turns off, but when I go back to the main settings screen and then return to the wifi settings screen, the wifi switch is back on again. In this situation, I go through a cycle of turning wifi off 3 - 8 times before it actually remains off.Text entry is simply uninspired. For all Apple's much bally-hewed design talents, they certainly didn't waste any cleverness surging beyond a basic keyboard. The phone's auto-complete feature is nice, but I had better auto-completion on a Palm V over 10 years ago. I pine for T9 to accelerate text entry.Built-in email is well integrated & supports multiple accounts. Build-in calendar is less versatile.Speaker phone is adequate, but I've had better from cheaper phones.Oh, and if you only want to use wifi-sourced data on your phone & avoid data plan fees, iPhones work perfectly fine without a data plan.At the risk of stating the obvious: if you don't have a data plan, you don't get google maps, email, etc. when you're out-of-range of a wifi network. For me, this is fine. The carriers categorize text messaging as non-data, so you can pay for that if you like.Sure, without data you take a hit on certain (& very few) phone features; the most significant & least obvious, I'd say, would be the log of outstanding voicemails the iPhone can show you.-- Without data, you just get an indicator that you have voicemail to be listened to.-- With data, you get an inventory of who left you voicemails at what times.***All*** iPhone apps have settings to enable/disable data transfer over the phone network. The phone also has a ""master"" setting for this, too.DO NOT let Verizon, Sprint, etc. tell you that a data plan is necessary to operate one of these on their networks. It's simply not so, and -- unless they've changed their tunes in the past 2 years -- they will not tell you this. Verizon & Sprint (and probably all other carriers) will make you get a data plan to have one of these on their network, and they won't tell you anything different. When I've asked them, they've been unequivocal on this requirement. Their justification for this is completely bogus; namely that smart phones need data to operate.I've learned, however, of 2 ways to get around this requirement.1 - get a pay-as-you-go account2 - piggy back your iPhone on an account with someone else's iPhone that has a data plan.(in my case, my wife's work pays for her phone & plan; I piggy-back on the account, but don't use data.",,2,8

When I took it to an apple store, they said it had been hampered with and thus they couldn't replace it unless I wanted to pay $750.So then I had to buy another one (obviously I couldn't go back to not having words with friends)...I bought from an apple dealer and paid a little extra for the warranty.

In the last 47 years of my life I have never bought an Apple Personal Computer and I have only bought 3 apple devices which we have sold them all.

I opted to check out what was being offered for last year's iPhone on Amazon and found a reasonably priced slightly used iPhone 4 with a great deal of memory. The device works as expected, no blemishes (at least none that I could find and I think there was mention of typical minor wear and tear - I saw none but I think that has to be put out there for used/refurb devices) and all cords, chargers were included in packaging. It was delivered early and my son is thoroughly pleased to go from a free Samsung smartphone to an iPhone 4 (granted he wanted the 5 but he's 15 - he'll live...besides he's happy to be at the same level his friends are at with their phones).

When receiving the phone it worked well for a couple of months, then suddenly the phone screen completely shut off. The next day I took it to the Apple Store and had them look at it. The Apple associate then told me that the phone had been refurbished with third party parts and the screen had been replaced, and since the phone had the 3rd party parts, I was unable to get it fixed. I have emailed the seller about this, thinking perhaps it was a confusion, but they have not responded.",,3,3

It looked like it had been used, but was in no way, shape or form ""heavily scratched."" Long story short I got $100 less on my trade-in because, as the email stated, it was ""heavily scratched.""

Apple iPhone 4 8GB - White - AT&T,Apple,179.99,1,This iphone4 cost me twenty dollars in gas and a day's work trying to get this phone fixed. I went back and forth from an apple store and my service provider. Apple gave me a new phone because the one I purchased was still under warranty. After spending all day trying to get the phone to work the apple service rep went in the back room and got the original phone and did a history check from the original owner up until I got the phone. Status unlocked: False. The apple rep told me they could not change the status of the phone they were required to return my new phone with the same set up as the old phone. The apple rep said until the person or company I got the phone from change the settings to factory unlocked there would not be anything I could do with this phone. I sent an email to Amazon about the problem and they were going to contact the provider with this issue. To date I have heard nothing from the provider or Amazon. If I could rate the product with a zero star I would. Right now I have spent over three hundred dollars out of my pocket and lost a day's work. The best thing I could do with this phone is make a boat anchor with it but it would not even be good for that. I found out by trying to save money it would have been better just to buy a new phone.

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB Black (GSM Unlocked),Apple,75,1,"It wasn’t only a refurbished item instead of unused item. The IPhone 4 I received and sent back is a fraud.On october 17, I spent more than 2 hours at the Genius Bar of Apple Store at 5th Avenue, New York. They recommended me to do a back up first and come back the other day.The following day, 18, in Apple Store at 14th Street, New York, I spent another 2 hours at the Genius Bar just to know 1) that they couldn't just replace the phone because it was out of warranty - it expired two years before, one year after it had been bought by its first owner, in June 2010. So if wanted a replacement I'd have to pay US$ 150 for it - which I accepted; and 2) at the very moment of the transaction, the guy who served me at the shop counter noticed something in the iPhone and asked me to wait. He checked the serial number and found that the iPhone was originally a black one - the one I bought was a white one. He couldn't replace it.They didn't have a new iPhone 4 to sell, and I needed desperately to buy a cell phone because I was leaving the next day to Brazil. I bought an iPhone 5C unlocked for $649 + taxes, as you can see in the annexed file. Total: US$ 706.59.If you want to be fair, please deposit the difference of U$ 266,50 (706,59 - 439,98) I had to pay. I wont charge for the four hours of my vacation I wasted at Apple’s counter, neither for the worry and inconvenience I had with your item .I send alrady several emails and I'm still waiting for an answer.

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB Black (GSM Unlocked),Apple,75,2,"As stated in the description, the iPhone had little to no scratches around the phone. Good Job here. After turning it on, here's where the problems began to stir up. Due note that I previously owned a 4s prior and only ordered this one because I loved the phone, lost the phone and thought I'd try another one.Music - I'm a BIG fan of music. With this phone, I am not able to play music, smoothly from Tune In as once before. The issue starts whenever I have Wifi and Carrier service on at the same time. Never a problem with prior.GMaps + Music - Normally, I could listen to music while getting directions from GMaps. With this phone, every turn-by-turn direction causes my music to stop completely and I have to press play in order to start the music again. Never a problem with prior.Home Double-Tap Button - When I attempt to use this feature to navigate through opened apps, it would work about 1 out of 5 tries. Never a problem with prior.Wifi On/Off - Normally, I could turn my wifi on/off, interchangeably, between use with apps and never had a problem; however, apps recognize that the wifi is off and only consider this the designated source for data transfer. To fix, I've had to turn the phone off completely for it to refresh. Never a problem with prior.I am currently in the process of returning this phone, for they have a 90 Day Return policy. Fingers are crossed to see if I get a better replacement.Hopefully this review has helped make a decision for you in the future.",,1,2

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB Black (GSM Unlocked),Apple,75,4,"When I bought this phone, it arrived packaged as new, and it worked and looked fine with no problems. However, it came with iOS 7.1.1, which is rather confusing since that OS came out more than 2 years after the phone did. When I questioned the seller about it, they said that it was updated by Apple before they liquidated the phone off to the seller. Since I had specifically wanted it to have the original iOS, I returned it without any hassle.TL;DR - If you want the original iOS, don't buy this phone.",,1,4

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB Black (GSM Unlocked),Apple,75,1,"When I got the package everything looked all right, but appearances can be deceiving. The USB connector would not accept any cable, just the one shipped inside. This is weird, but I could live with that glitch. Then, 2 weeks later, I noticed that all pictures taken with the front camera got blured and the 5M Pixels back camera had some issues in focusing the image.After 2 months using, I figured some extra bad surprises. The front speaker just went dead 3 days ago, the phone wont ring or produce any sound anymore!!!! Also, there is something wrong with the earphone jack as well, because during song playing we can hear ""pops"" and sudden pauses, just like in vynil players. Moreover, the ""Face Proximity Sensor"" never worked, but I didnt even know it exists, so I could not find out sooner.I took it to an Apple authorized Repair Shop, and to my surprise I was informed that identified that the iPhone was refurbished with a lot of low quality spare parts, including the cameras (back and front ones), and even the front touch screen glass!!I have no doubt that the phone was not ""Very good"" as advertised. Not at all!! I payed a good money for it, and will cost me a lot of extra money to repair it, which is not acceptable.",,17,17

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB Black (GSM Unlocked),Apple,75,1,"Bought2 of these through Vantage Cellular. The phones were wrapped like new. Looked great. All appeared good. Then little things were noticed. When the screen went black I would see phantom keyboard characters throughout the screen. Similar to how monitors react if the same picture stays on too long and the pixels freeze, same thins with this. I was supposed to get iPhone 4S', not 4's. I even verified the link after purchase and it showed up 4S. Now I had a problem with one phone not turning on and just a black screen. Was told it was the battery, when the phone was opened to replace said battery, low and behold - These aren't real iPhones. So now my ordered iPhone 4S' turn out to be fake iPhone 4's. Will will say 'return them and why did you not send them back right away?'

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB Black (GSM Unlocked),Apple,75,3,"After saving up for several months, I was able to purchase my very first high-end phone. At the time I first bought this phone, it was still considered out of date, but I didn't care. I was very excited to finally have an all in one high quality music player, cell phone, and handheld computer. I remember being most excited, besides the app inclusions, that this product had 32 whole gb to play with. That was more than I'd ever had in my mp3 players/ ipods of the past.Pros-Huge GB Space-App Store-High quality music playback (However, I believe the Sansa line of Mp3 players has a much better quality of music playback and higher volume offering. This is the only one I have found.)-Glass pieces rather than plastic-Unlocked for use with multiple phone servicesCons-Buggy at times-Outdated-Does not support many apps-New OS does not run very smoothly on this-One speaker was busted-Grossly overpriced-You can find an Andriod that improves on this system in every way for a quarter of the priceI have since updated to a less expensive Android phone with expandable memory (LG K700) as even the cheap ones run better OS than this old thing nowadays. For the time though, this piece of software was very innovative and very exciting to have. If you are in the market for a new phone, I would recommend a newer piece of equipment though, rather than springing for this item, even if it is the Apple Store you are looking for. Many apps do not even run on this any longer. A new andriod would save your pocket some dough, and offer you higher improvements.",,1,3

When I contacted them about the problem and returned it, they said they would 'have their technicians inspect it' before refunding the money. The phone most definitely did not work and they got back to me saying that their technicians couldnt find anything wrong with the phone and that they would refund me, but charge me a ""restocking fee"" since the phone was now ""used.""On top of that, they sent me fake headphones and a fake charging cord. Apple blocks unauthorized lightning cords and when I finally gave up with the phone and went to back it up before returning it, the cord never worked, never charged the phone, and couldnt form a connection with my itunes. The battery life on the phone was also practically nothing which leads me to believe the phone was either also fake or used/refurbished. Either one sucks since I paid for what was listed as a new phone and ended up paying them to take it back ""used"" - probably to sell it to someone else new again.If I could I would give 0 stars.

The IPhone 4 I received and sent back is a fraud.On october 17, I spent more than 2 hours at the Genius Bar of Apple Store at 5th Avenue, New York. They recommended me to do a back up first and come back the other day.The following day, 18, in Apple Store at 14th Street, New York, I spent another 2 hours at the Genius Bar just to know 1) that they couldn't just replace the phone because it was out of warranty - it expired two years before, one year after it had been bought by its first owner, in June 2010. So if wanted a replacement I'd have to pay US$ 150 for it - which I accepted; and 2) at the very moment of the transaction, the guy who served me at the shop counter noticed something in the iPhone and asked me to wait. He checked the serial number and found that the iPhone was originally a black one - the one I bought was a white one. He couldn't replace it.They didn't have a new iPhone 4 to sell, and I needed desperately to buy a cell phone because I was leaving the next day to Brazil. I bought an iPhone 5C unlocked for $649 + taxes, as you can see in the annexed file.

After turning it on, here's where the problems began to stir up. Due note that I previously owned a 4s prior and only ordered this one because I loved the phone, lost the phone and thought I'd try another one.Music - I'm a BIG fan of music. With this phone, I am not able to play music, smoothly from Tune In as once before. The issue starts whenever I have Wifi and Carrier service on at the same time. Never a problem with prior.GMaps + Music - Normally, I could listen to music while getting directions from GMaps. With this phone, every turn-by-turn direction causes my music to stop completely and I have to press play in order to start the music again. Never a problem with prior.Home Double-Tap Button - When I attempt to use this feature to navigate through opened apps, it would work about 1 out of 5 tries. Never a problem with prior.Wifi On/Off - Normally, I could turn my wifi on/off, interchangeably, between use with apps and never had a problem; however, apps recognize that the wifi is off and only consider this the designated source for data transfer. To fix, I've had to turn the phone off completely for it to refresh. Never a problem with prior.I am currently in the process of returning this phone, for they have a 90 Day Return policy. Fingers are crossed to see if I get a better replacement.Hopefully this review has helped make a decision for you in the future.",,1,2

Unsurprising the phone is not New. It was Sold in a Best Buy in 2010 (thanks to the apple store guys for checking it for me). It has no warranty, obviously because it is not new but at least the internal parts are all legitimate apple components. The plastic screen protectors have been removed and put back on again - you can tell because there are specks of dirt or grit all over it (another point to it being second hand). On the plus side it does indeed appear to be Unlocked. Not going to return it, it looks in good enough condition. Hopefully it is not going to die in the first few months.",,2,6

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB White (GSM Unlocked),Apple,138.97,1,"When I got the package everything looked all right, but appearances can be deceiving. The USB connector would not accept any cable, just the one shipped inside. This is weird, but I could live with that glitch. Then, 2 weeks later, I noticed that all pictures taken with the front camera got blured and the 5M Pixels back camera had some issues in focusing the image.After 2 months using, I figured some extra bad surprises. The front speaker just went dead 3 days ago, the phone wont ring or produce any sound anymore!!!! Also, there is something wrong with the earphone jack as well, because during song playing we can hear ""pops"" and sudden pauses, just like in vynil players. Moreover, the ""Face Proximity Sensor"" never worked, but I didnt even know it exists, so I could not find out sooner.I took it to an Apple authorized Repair Shop, and to my surprise I was informed that identified that the iPhone was refurbished with a lot of low quality spare parts, including the cameras (back and front ones), and even the front touch screen glass!!I have no doubt that the phone was not ""Very good"" as advertised. Not at all!! I payed a good money for it, and will cost me a lot of extra money to repair it, which is not acceptable.",,17,17

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB White (GSM Unlocked),Apple,138.97,1,"Check out this facebook page that outlines their shady business practices: [...]The 1-star rating is not for the iphone itself - that would be a 5-star. The 1-star rating is for the seller - WIREOVIAI bought this in March 2012, seeing that it was ""Factory Unlocked by Apple, Never Opened"" and ""New In Shrink-Wrap and Original Packaging"".Just yesterday, a little over 2 months of having the phone, the speaker stopped working so I bring it into Apple, thinking it would be covered under warranty.The apple employee informs me that the iphone was owned and registered in September 2010 - 17 months before I bought this ""new"" iphone.Do not buy ANYTHING from this vendor - WIREOVIA - as you cannot trust the authenticity of what they're selling! What you buy would also not be covered under the manufacturer's warranty if it's older than you think it is.

I tried several tests to ensure the problem and finally I went to apple website and follow the resolution but for no improvement. But when I tried to enter the serial no and seek help from Apple specialists system denied saying 'Service coverage expired' where as I am supposed to get 1 yr warranty as per the seller commitment.I looks like although this is claimed as New, it is a replaced/refurbished phone. I felt very sad and need to return it.",,67,67

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB White (GSM Unlocked),Apple,138.97,1,"Bought2 of these through Vantage Cellular. The phones were wrapped like new. Looked great. All appeared good. Then little things were noticed. When the screen went black I would see phantom keyboard characters throughout the screen. Similar to how monitors react if the same picture stays on too long and the pixels freeze, same thins with this. I was supposed to get iPhone 4S', not 4's. I even verified the link after purchase and it showed up 4S. Now I had a problem with one phone not turning on and just a black screen. Was told it was the battery, when the phone was opened to replace said battery, low and behold - These aren't real iPhones. So now my ordered iPhone 4S' turn out to be fake iPhone 4's. Will will say 'return them and why did you not send them back right away?' Well, I work overseas and was only home to pick them up for a very short time and returning them was out of the question as the phones were needed when I returned. So how do we fix this?

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB White (GSM Unlocked),Apple,138.97,1,The main reason I did not like this product is that from the time it arrived it did not work properly. The docking charging slot was misaligned as were the screws holding it in place. I damaged 2 charging cables trying to use it. When I could finally take it to mu apple dealer he looked up the serial and discovered that it was in reality a used phone purchased over a year before whose warranty was expired. amazon stood by its warranty and refunded me but it was a hassle for me because I live outside the usa and am now trying to get a replacement for my phone. I will never knowingly buy from these folks again,,2,2
Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB White (GSM Unlocked),Apple,138.97,3,"After saving up for several months, I was able to purchase my very first high-end phone. At the time I first bought this phone, it was still considered out of date, but I didn't care. I was very excited to finally have an all in one high quality music player, cell phone, and handheld computer. I remember being most excited, besides the app inclusions, that this product had 32 whole gb to play with. That was more than I'd ever had in my mp3 players/ ipods of the past.Pros-Huge GB Space-App Store-High quality music playback (However, I believe the Sansa line of Mp3 players has a much better quality of music playback and higher volume offering. This is the only one I have found.)-Glass pieces rather than plastic-Unlocked for use with multiple phone servicesCons-Buggy at times-Outdated-Does not support many apps-New OS does not run very smoothly on this-One speaker was busted-Grossly overpriced-You can find an Andriod that improves on this system in every way for a quarter of the priceI have since updated to a less expensive Android phone with expandable memory (LG K700) as even the cheap ones run better OS than this old thing nowadays. For the time though, this piece of software was very innovative and very exciting to have. If you are in the market for a new phone, I would recommend a newer piece of equipment though, rather than springing for this item, even if it is the Apple Store you are looking for. Many apps do not even run on this any longer. A new andriod would save your pocket some dough, and offer you higher improvements.",,1,3

Totally unacceptable. I bought another iPhone 4 from a different seller and it was exactly as it was described. Needless to say, I was very happy with the other seller.

I had to return the phone after spending hours looking online for solutions and trying to figure out what the problem was. When I contacted them about the problem and returned it, they said they would 'have their technicians inspect it' before refunding the money. The phone most definitely did not work and they got back to me saying that their technicians couldnt find anything wrong with the phone and that they would refund me, but charge me a ""restocking fee"" since the phone was now ""used.""On top of that, they sent me fake headphones and a fake charging cord. Apple blocks unauthorized lightning cords and when I finally gave up with the phone and went to back it up before returning it, the cord never worked, never charged the phone, and couldnt form a connection with my itunes. The battery life on the phone was also practically nothing which leads me to believe the phone was either also fake or used/refurbished. Either one sucks since I paid for what was listed as a new phone and ended up paying them to take it back ""used"" - probably to sell it to someone else new again.If I could I would give 0 stars.

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB White (GSM Unlocked),Apple,138.97,2,"As stated in the description, the iPhone had little to no scratches around the phone. Good Job here. After turning it on, here's where the problems began to stir up. Due note that I previously owned a 4s prior and only ordered this one because I loved the phone, lost the phone and thought I'd try another one.Music - I'm a BIG fan of music. With this phone, I am not able to play music, smoothly from Tune In as once before. The issue starts whenever I have Wifi and Carrier service on at the same time. Never a problem with prior.GMaps + Music - Normally, I could listen to music while getting directions from GMaps. With this phone, every turn-by-turn direction causes my music to stop completely and I have to press play in order to start the music again. Never a problem with prior.Home Double-Tap Button - When I attempt to use this feature to navigate through opened apps, it would work about 1 out of 5 tries. Never a problem with prior.Wifi On/Off - Normally, I could turn my wifi on/off, interchangeably, between use with apps and never had a problem; however, apps recognize that the wifi is off and only consider this the designated source for data transfer. To fix, I've had to turn the phone off completely for it to refresh. Never a problem with prior.I am currently in the process of returning this phone, for they have a 90 Day Return policy. Fingers are crossed to see if I get a better replacement.Hopefully this review has helped make a decision for you in the future.",,1,2

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB White (GSM Unlocked),Apple,138.97,4,"When I bought this phone, it arrived packaged as new, and it worked and looked fine with no problems. However, it came with iOS 7.1.1, which is rather confusing since that OS came out more than 2 years after the phone did. When I questioned the seller about it, they said that it was updated by Apple before they liquidated the phone off to the seller. Since I had specifically wanted it to have the original iOS, I returned it without any hassle.TL;DR - If you want the original iOS, don't buy this phone.",,1,4
